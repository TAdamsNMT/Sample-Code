dllist.c and bincalc.c consist of an implementation and application in C of doubly 
linked lists.  In dllist.c, doubly linked lists are implemented as a structure  
with integers as the held data type.  This is used in bincalc.c, which performs 
various operations on binary integers specified by the user during runtime. 
In this case, the binary integers are stored in doubly linked lists in order to
allow for arbitrarily large operands.  The Makefile can be used in a Linux environment
to compile this. The C code is in Linux Kernel Style, and is documented with Doxygen
compliant comments

The Minesweeper, Internal, MFrame, and MPanel Java files are slightly older, and these
contain an implementation of the Minesweeper game following the Model-View-Controller 
model of GUI management, with Internal, MFrame, and MPanel objects being the Model, View,
and Controller, respectively.
