dllist.c and bincalc.c consist of an implementation and application in C of doubly 
linked lists.  In dllist.c, doubly linked lists are implemented as a structure  
with integers as the held data type.  This is used in bincalc.c, which performs 
various operations on binary integers specified by the user during runtime. 
In this case, the binary integers are stored in doubly linked lists in order to
allow for arbitrarily large operands.  The Makefile can be used in a Linux environment
to compile this.
